## Programming Language

Python

## Original Requirements

Develop an application that works in tandem with smart contracts on the Ethereum network that uses agents and / or bots to scrape the internet and blockchain for various currencies that were either lost in cyberspace due to an address mistake, technological malfunctions, forgotten or unowned currencies, free money, free currency for tasks that the bots and agents can perform to collect them, etc.  Please include a comprehensive 'Read Me' file and make sure that the output from here is test and launch ready and that no other coding needs to be done for the launch.  Also, for the requirements file, include the .json, but also include a .yaml if you do a python language.

## Project Name

crypto_recovery_agent

## Product Goals

- Develop a robust application that interacts with Ethereum smart contracts
- Automate the process of identifying and collecting various lost or unclaimed digital currencies
- Ensure the application is user-friendly and ready for launch with comprehensive documentation

## User Stories

- As a crypto enthusiast, I want the application to automatically find lost or unclaimed currencies so that I can recover assets without manual searching
- As a blockchain developer, I want to integrate this application with my projects to enhance the value of my services
- As a user, I want a comprehensive 'Read Me' file so that I can understand how to use the application and its features without external help

## Competitive Analysis

- Crypto Recovery Service A: Manual recovery service, high fees, slow process
- Blockchain Scanner B: Automated scanning, limited to specific currencies, not user-friendly
- Asset Finder C: Focuses on large unclaimed assets, ignores smaller balances, not integrated with smart contracts
- Lost Coin Recovery D: Good service, but requires extensive user input and lacks automation
- Smart Contract Helper E: Assists with smart contract interactions, but does not scrape for lost currencies

## Requirement Analysis

The application must be capable of interfacing with Ethereum smart contracts to automate the recovery of various digital currencies. It needs to be equipped with intelligent agents or bots that can scrape both the internet and blockchain. The application should handle errors such as address mistakes and identify unclaimed or forgotten currencies. A comprehensive 'Read Me' file is required for user guidance. The final product must be thoroughly tested and ready for launch without the need for additional coding. The requirements file must be provided in both .json and .yaml formats for Python.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Develop smart contract interaction capabilities for the Ethereum network']
- ['P0', 'Implement intelligent agents/bots for scraping lost or unclaimed currencies']
- ['P0', "Create a comprehensive 'Read Me' file for end-user documentation"]
- ['P1', 'Ensure the application is fully tested and launch-ready']
- ['P1', 'Provide requirements file in both .json and .yaml formats']

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a clean and intuitive dashboard that allows users to monitor the bot's activity, view recovered assets, and access the 'Read Me' and documentation. There will be clear navigation for setting up the bot's parameters and a real-time display of the scraping and recovery process.

## Anything UNCLEAR

It is unclear how the application will handle the legal implications of recovering currencies and what measures will be in place to ensure compliance with various jurisdictions' laws.
