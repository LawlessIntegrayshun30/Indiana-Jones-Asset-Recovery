## Implementation approach

We will utilize the web3.py library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. For web scraping, we will use Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries. To automate tasks, we will employ the APScheduler library. We will ensure that the architecture is simple, modular, and uses appropriate open-source libraries to meet the requirements.

## Program call flow

    participant SCI as SmartContractInteraction
    participant WS as WebScraper
    participant CR as CurrencyRecovery
    participant S as Scheduler
    M->>SCI: connect_to_contract('contract_address')
    M->>S: schedule_task(CR.recover_lost_currencies, 'interval', 60)
    loop Every Minute
        S->>WS: scrape_for_currencies('target_url')
        WS-->>CR: return currencies_info

        CR-->>M: return recovered_currencies
    end
    M->>CR: display_recovered_currencies()
    CR-->>M: return recovered_currencies


## Anything UNCLEAR

It is unclear how the application will handle the legal implications of recovering currencies and what measures will be in place to ensure compliance with various jurisdictions' laws. Further clarification on the legal framework within which the application operates would be beneficial.
