{"Implementation approach":"We will utilize the web3.py library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. For web scraping, we will use Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries. To automate tasks, we will employ the APScheduler library. We will ensure that the architecture is simple, modular, and uses appropriate open-source libraries to meet the requirements.","File list":["main.py","smart_contract_interaction.py","web_scraper.py","currency_recovery.py","scheduler.py","readme_generator.py","requirements.json","requirements.yaml"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        -SmartContractInteraction smart_contract_interaction\n        -WebScraper web_scraper\n        -CurrencyRecovery currency_recovery\n        -Scheduler scheduler\n        +run() void\n    }\n    class SmartContractInteraction {\n        +connect_to_contract(address: str)\n        +execute_contract_function(function_name: str, params: list)\n    }\n    class WebScraper {\n        +scrape_for_currencies(url: str) dict\n    }\n    class CurrencyRecovery {\n        -recovered_currencies: dict\n        +recover_lost_currencies(currencies_info: dict)\n        +display_recovered_currencies() dict\n    }\n    class Scheduler {\n        +schedule_task(task: function, trigger: str, interval: int)\n    }\n    class ReadmeGenerator {\n        +generate_readme(content: dict) str\n    }\n    Main --> SmartContractInteraction\n    Main --> WebScraper\n    Main --> CurrencyRecovery\n    Main --> Scheduler\n    CurrencyRecovery --> SmartContractInteraction\n    CurrencyRecovery --> WebScraper\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant SCI as SmartContractInteraction\n    participant WS as WebScraper\n    participant CR as CurrencyRecovery\n    participant S as Scheduler\n    M->>SCI: connect_to_contract('contract_address')\n    M->>S: schedule_task(CR.recover_lost_currencies, 'interval', 60)\n    loop Every Minute\n        S->>WS: scrape_for_currencies('target_url')\n        WS-->>CR: return currencies_info\n        CR->>SCI: execute_contract_function('recover_funds', [currencies_info])\n        SCI-->>CR: return transaction_receipt\n        CR->>CR: recover_lost_currencies(currencies_info)\n        CR-->>M: return recovered_currencies\n    end\n    M->>CR: display_recovered_currencies()\n    CR-->>M: return recovered_currencies\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"It is unclear how the application will handle the legal implications of recovering currencies and what measures will be in place to ensure compliance with various jurisdictions' laws.
